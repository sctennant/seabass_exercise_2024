# SeaBASS 2024 - Elucidating right whale vocal behavior for acoustic monitoring

## Description
The critical nature of the North Atlantic right whale population has warranted a large amount of research and acoustic monitoring, but these efforts are primairly restricted to certain areas, one common call type, and offer little other information about the vocalizers.  Through my PhD I hope to use both hydrophone and acoustic tag data to better determine the vocal behavior and repertoire of right whales.  While my work so far has sought to establish other call types to be used in species monitoring and detection, I also want to study what information is encoded in the variability within these call types to optimize the information gained from acoustic monitoring.
